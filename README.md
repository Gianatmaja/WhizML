# WhizML

A reusable codebase for fast data science and machine learning experimentation,
integrating various open-source tools to support automatic EDA, ML models experimentation
and tracking, model inference, model explainability, bias, and data drift analysis.


## Quick Examples

Take a look at these repositories below for a quick overview of how WhizML can
help streamline initial data science and machine learning development.


## Tech Stack

Some of the main open-source tools used in developing this codebase include:

- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Used for ML model training.
- [D-Tale](https://pypi.org/project/dtale/): Used for automating the EDA process.
- [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/): Used for experiment tracking and ML model management.
- [Explainer-Dashboard](https://explainerdashboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Used for model explainabillity.
- [EvidentlyAI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/): Used for identifying data drift.

The complete set of requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.
